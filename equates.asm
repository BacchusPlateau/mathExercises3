; CIO (Central I/O) constants
; CIO is the Atari OS I/O system. We use it to open graphics mode.
; Each I/O channel uses an IOCB (I/O Control Block) — a fixed block
; of memory containing command, device, buffer address, and aux bytes.
; We use IOCB6 (base address $0360) for graphics.
; X register = $60 tells CIOV which IOCB to use (IOCB6).
; =====================================================================

; =====================================================================
; Screen RAM pointer
; After CIO opens GR.8, the OS stores the address of screen RAM
; in SAVMSC (two bytes). $58 = low byte, $59 = high byte.
; On our 800XL PAL system screen RAM ends up at $B060.
; =====================================================================

                    ; $59 automatically contains the high byte

; =====================================================================
; Attract mode constants
; The Atari OS has an attract mode that kicks in after inactivity
; to prevent screen burn-in. It does this by desaturating all colors
; making everything appear as shades of grey/blue.
; We must continuously reset these in our main loop to keep colors!
; =====================================================================
ATRACT  = $4D       ; attract mode counter — OS increments this each frame
                    ; when it reaches a threshold attract mode activates

                    ; $FE strips hue leaving only luminance (grey/blue)
                    ; $FF = full color (no masking) — what we want

; =====================================================================
; Player-Missile Graphics (PMG) constants
; PMG is dedicated GTIA/ANTIC hardware for moving sprites — completely
; separate from the GR.8 bitmap screen RAM we've been drawing into.
; ANTIC reads this memory automatically every frame and GTIA overlays
; it on top of the playfield, with zero CPU cost for the overlay itself.
; =====================================================================

PMBASE  = $5000     ; start of our PM memory block. MUST be page-aligned
                    ; (low byte = $00) because ANTIC only stores a HIGH
                    ; byte pointer to this memory — there's no low byte
                    ; register, so the low byte is implicitly always $00

; --- DMACTL bit for enabling PM DMA (added to what openGR8 already sets) ---
; DMACTL is the SAME register as SDMCTL we already use in openGR8 —
; PM graphics needs an ADDITIONAL bit set on top of what we already
; configure for the playfield, not a separate register
PMG_ENABLE_BIT = %00010000   ; bit 4 of SDMCTL enables single-line
                            ; resolution PM DMA (we'll OR this into
                            ; whatever openGR8 already sets)
SDMCTL  = $022F     ; OS shadow register for DMA control — CIO already
                    ; writes the correct playfield bits here when
                    ; opening a graphics mode; we OR in our PM bit
